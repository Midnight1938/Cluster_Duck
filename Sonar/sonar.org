* Sonar
A Program to calculate the distance from a thing based on how long it takes for the sound to reach you.

The program is in 3 languages for the fun of it.

** In Python
#+begin_src python
def expo_calc(time=0):
    if time == 0:
        return "The time was taken as 0.\nYou are dead, congrats."
    elif time > 0:
        return (f"The distance is between a {time*343} meter radius.")
    else:
        return "You are dead."
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
def lit_calc(diff=0):
    if diff == 0:
        return "Youre in it, either watch or seek shelter"
    if diff > 0:
        return (f"You are {diff*343} meters from the storm. Good luck")
    else:
        return "Wut"

def main():
    print("Hi! Count the seconds btwn when you saw the light and the sound first. Or guess, no ones judging\n")
    print("What do you want to calculate?\n1. Explosion\n2. Lightning\n3. Quit")
    
    chois = int(input("\nPick the num: "))
    
    if chois == 1:
        explo_tim = float(input(
            "What was the time diffrence between the cloud and the kaboom? "))
        print(expo_calc(time=explo_tim))
    elif chois == 2:
        flash_thun_tim = float(
            input("What was the time btwn flash and thunder? "))
        print(lit_calc(diff=flash_thun_tim))
    elif chois == 3:
        print("Bye have a great time")

** In Rust
Admittedly my first time writing something in rust from scratch.
Experience: Complicated, but good
#+begin_src rust

        println!("The time was taken as 0.\nYou are dead, congrats.");
    }
    else if time > 0{
        println!("The explosion was within a {} meter radius.",time*343);
    }
    else{
        println!("You are dead.");
    }
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src rust
fn lit_calc(diff: i32){
    if diff == 0{

        println!("Youre in it, either watch or seek shelter");
    }
    if diff > 0{

        println!("You are {} meters from the storm. Good luck",diff*343);
    }
    else{

        println!("Wut");
    }
}
